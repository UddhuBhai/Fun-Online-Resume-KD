## 📄 About This Project

This isn’t a serious resume. It’s better.
It’s a tribute to Krishna Daryani’s *awesomeness*, wrapped in some HTML and sprinkled with sass.

Built as a joke? Yes.
Built with heart? Also yes. ❤️

## ⚙️ Built Using

* 🧱 HTML (because we like it old-school)
* 🧠 No frameworks. Just raw genius.

---

## 🔥 Why It Exists

* For laughs 😄
* For memories 🕰️
* For Krishna 💪

Sometimes, a friend just needs a website that screams:
**“This guy is built different.”**

## 🙋‍♂️ Who Made This?

Crafted by Uddhav Matholia — the web developer Krishna didn’t ask for but absolutely deserves.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This resume is a joke. But Krishna’s greatness? That’s 100% real.
